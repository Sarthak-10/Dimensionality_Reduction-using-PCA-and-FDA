# Dimensionality_Reduction-using-PCA-and-FDA

The given ipynb file contains the solution to the problem statement attached.In the file the following techniques have been demonstrated:-

1) Visualizing the CIFAR-10 Dataset
2) Performing LDA on the CIFAR-10 dataset

**About the CIFAR 10 Dataset**:  The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.The 10 classes in the dataset are airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship,and truck. The classes are completely mutually exclusive.

You can read more about the dataset as well as download the dataset from [this](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) link.

3) Performing PCA to reduce the dimensions of the MNIST Dataset from 784 to 15, 8 and 3.
4) Comparing  the accuracies obtained after dimensionality reduction with the help of bar graph.

**About the MNIST Dataset**:  The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

5) Applying FDA from scratch on the FMNIST dataset
6) Applying LDA on the results obtained by FDA

**About the FMNIST Dataset**:  Fashion-MNIST(FMNIST) is a dataset consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.The 10 classes are T-shirt/Top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag,and Ankle Boot.Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
